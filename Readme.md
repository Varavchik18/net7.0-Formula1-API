I havent developed API's for over 1 year and in order to get prepared I started with developing simple API using .net7

Here is the technology stack what I used: 
1. .net 7
2. Logger
3. Entity framework core (EF7)
4. SQLite
5. ef tools
 
 
Here is the terms and solutions what I studied and implemented :
1. Unit of work pattern
2. Repository pattern
3. Configuration files such launchSettings.json

As a feature I want to notice a generic class for repository pattern implementation. Such thing I haven't done yet.
